How do I roll back to a previous catalog version?
-------------------------------------------------

Agent Catalog was built on the principle of agent *snapshots*.
Consequently, it is possible to roll back to a previous catalog version :math:`v` if you have :math:`v`'s version ID.
Some common use cases for rolling back to a previous catalog version include performing A/B testing on different
versions of your agent or rolling back your agent due to some regression.

Catalog versions are Git commit hashes.
To roll back to a previous catalog version, follow these steps:

1. **List Catalog Versions** : Start by running the :command:`agentc status` command with the ``--status-db`` flag to
   list all the published catalog versions of tools in your bucket (here, we are checking in ``travel-sample``):

   .. code-block:: bash

       # run agentc status --help for all options
       agentc status --kind tool --status-db --bucket travel-sample

   Running the command above will return a list of all the tool catalog snapshots you have published to Couchbase.

2. **Browse Git Commits**: Next, check the ``catalog id`` from the above output for the Git commit hash at which the
   catalogs were published to the database.
   Open your repository commit history on Github or run the :command:`git log` command in your terminal to view the
   commit history for your project.
   Once you have a comprehensive list of commits, you can decide which catalog version to roll back to.

3. **Perform Rollback**: When you decide which catalog version you want to roll back to, you can move forward
   (or rather, "backward") in three ways:

   a. To revert your changes to a specific commit in a non-destructive manner, run :command:`git revert`.

      .. code-block:: bash

          git revert <commit_hash>..HEAD

      This command will rollback your repository to `<commit_hash>` *but* with a new commit hash.
      This is a safe way to rollback to a previous version without losing your current work, as your existing
      Git commit history will be preserved.

   b. To checkout a particular commit (i.e., all changes associated with some commit), run :command:`git checkout`.

      .. code-block:: bash

          git checkout <commit_hash>

      This command will checkout the commit `<commit_hash>` without creating a new commit.

   c. To revert your changes to a specific commit in a **destructive** manner, run :command:`git reset`.

      .. code-block:: bash

          git reset --hard <commit_hash>

      This command will reset your working Git HEAD to the provided commit if you have not published your changes so
      far.
      **This command is destructive, so make sure all your changes have been committed or are stashed beforehand!**

   For further information on Git, please refer to git documentation
   `here <https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet>`_ .


What environment variables are required to use Agent Catalog?
-------------------------------------------------------------

To get started with Agent Catalog, you'll need to initialize certain environment variables.
These can be in a ``.env`` file located at the root of your project (where all of your :command:`agentc` commands are
run) *or* manually using :command:`export`.

Make sure to review the required variables and populate them with appropriate values before starting your project.

.. code-block:: ini

       ------------------------------------------ REQUIRED -----------------------------------------
       # Agent Catalog specific environment variables that identify where the catalog is stored.
       AGENT_CATALOG_CONN_STRING=localhost
       AGENT_CATALOG_USERNAME=Administrator
       AGENT_CATALOG_PASSWORD=password
       AGENT_CATALOG_BUCKET=travel-sample

       ------------------------------------------ OPTIONAL ------------------------------------------
       # Couchbase specific environment variables (for the travel-agent example tools).
       CB_CONN_STRING=couchbase://localhost
       CB_USERNAME=Administrator
       CB_PASSWORD=password

       # ControlFlow specific environment variables (which are really just Prefect environment variables).
       CONTROLFLOW_TOOLS_VERBOSE=true
       PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL=CRITICAL
       PREFECT_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4200/api"

       # To stop sentence_transformers from being fussy about multiple imports.
       TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false

       # The holy OpenAI API key. :-)
       OPENAI_API_KEY=...

For more information on Agent Catalog environment variables, refer to the documentation `here <env>`_.

What are the different types of tools and prompts I can create?
---------------------------------------------------------------
You can define four types of tools and two types of prompts, each designed for different functionalities:

1. **Tools**

* **Python Functions** (``.py``) - Define Python functions with specific inputs and outputs, following the prescribed function definitions. The functions are tagged with the ``@tool`` decorator for easy identification and use.

* **SQL++ Query** (``.sqlpp``) - Create Couchbase SQL++ queries that run on your cluster, returning results based on a schema you define. This tool is ideal for working with structured data stored in Couchbase.

* **Semantic Search** (``.yaml``) - Perform semantic searches on specific fields within documents using Couchbase Vector Search. This tool allows you to search for documents by meaning rather than exact keyword matches.

* **HTTP Requests** (``.yaml``) - Configure REST API calls to external endpoints of your choice for data retrieval or interaction. These tools are useful for interacting with external services, retrieving or sending data, or triggering workflows that rely on third-party APIs.

2. **Prompts** - TODO

* **Jinja** (``.jinja``) - These prompts utilize the Jinja templating engine to create dynamic and flexible input templates. They allow you to craft prompts with placeholders, which can be filled at runtime based on the specific context of the agent, enabling powerful and reusable prompt generation.

* **Raw prompts** (``.prompt``) - Raw prompts are static, predefined text-based instructions for the language model. They are written directly as plain text without any dynamic elements. These are best suited for straightforward tasks that require a single-shot interaction or fixed wording for the prompt.


Refer to the templates `here <https://github.com/couchbaselabs/agent-catalog/tree/master/resources/templates>`_ for more information on how to write each tool and prompt.

Can I write multiple tools/prompts in one file?
-----------------------------------------------
It is possible to define multiple tools in a single file for certain types of tools, while prompts must be written one per file.

For Python tools (``record_kind`` = ``python_function``), you can include multiple tools in a single ``.py`` file, as each tool is uniquely identified with the ``@tool`` decorator. Additionally, if you are defining HTTP tools (``record_kind`` = ``http_request``) in YAML, you may specify multiple path entries within the same file, provided that they share the same API specification.

Examples illustrating this are shown below:

.. code-block:: python
       :caption: Example of multiple python tools in a single .py file

       from agentc_core.tool import tool

       @tool
       def search_best_flight_deals() -> list[FlightDeal]:
           """Search for the best flight deals."""
           return None


       @tool
       def create_packing_checklist() -> list[PackingChecklistItem]:
           """Create a packing checklist."""
           return None

.. code-block:: yaml
       :caption: Example of multiple http request tools in a single yaml file

       record_kind: http_request

       open_api:
         filename: ../rewards_spec.json
         operations:
           - path: /create                       # ===> considered as one tool
             method: post
           - path: /rewards/{member_id}          # ===> considered as another tool
             method: get


For other types of tools and for all prompts, you must define one tool or prompt per file. If you'd like to auto-download tools or prompts using default configurations, you can refer to the ``agentc add`` command in the documentation `here <cli.html#agentc-add>`_.

Do CLI commands need to be executed in an order?

TODO

Does Agent Catalog require an OpenAI API key?
----------------------------------------------

Agent Catalog does not require an OpenAI API key.

Does Agent Catalog work with any LLM?
-------------------------------------

Yes!
Agent Catalog does not restrict you to a specific language model.
You are free to choose any LLM for your agent workflow development (if your chosen agent framework supports your chosen
LLM).
