How do I roll back to a previous catalog version?
-------------------------------------------------

Agent Catalog was built on the principle of agent *snapshots*.
Consequently, it is possible to roll back to a previous catalog version :math:`v` if you have :math:`v`'s version ID.
Some common use cases for rolling back to a previous catalog version include performing A/B testing on different
versions of your agent or rolling back your agent due to some regression.

Catalog versions are Git commit hashes.
To roll back to a previous catalog version, follow these steps:

1. **List Catalog Versions** : Start by running the :command:`agentc status` command with the ``--status-db`` flag to
   list all the published catalog versions of tools in your bucket (here, we are checking in ``travel-sample``):

   .. code-block:: bash

       # run agentc status --help for all options
       agentc status --kind tool --status-db --bucket travel-sample

   Running the command above will return a list of all the tool catalog snapshots you have published to Couchbase.

       -----------------------------------------------------------------

2. **Browse Git Commits**: Next, check the ``catalog id`` from the above output for the Git commit hash at which the
   catalogs were published to the database.
   Open your repository commit history on Github or run the :command:`git log` command in your terminal to view the
   commit history for your project.
   Once you have a comprehensive list of commits, you can decide which catalog version to roll back to.

3. **Perform Rollback**: When you decide which catalog version you want to roll back to, you can move forward
   (or rather, "backward") in three ways:

   a. To revert your changes to a specific commit in a non-destructive manner, run :command:`git revert`.

      .. code-block:: bash

          git revert <commit_hash>..HEAD

      This command will rollback your repository to `<commit_hash>` *but* with a new commit hash.
      This is a safe way to rollback to a previous version without losing your current work, as your existing
      Git commit history will be preserved.

   b. To checkout a particular commit (i.e., all changes associated with some commit), run :command:`git checkout`.

       .. code-block:: bash

           git checkout <commit_hash>

       This command will checkout the commit `<commit_hash>` without creating a new commit.

   c. To revert your changes to a specific commit in a **destructive** manner, run :command:`git reset`.

      .. code-block:: bash

          git reset --hard <commit_hash>

      This command will reset your working Git HEAD to the provided commit if you have not published your changes so
      far.
      **This command is destructive, so make sure all your changes have been committed or are stashed beforehand!**

   For further information on Git, please refer to git documentation
   `here <https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet>`_ .


What should my .env contain?
----------------------------

To get started with Agent Catalog, you'll need to initialize certain environment variables in a ``.env`` file located at the
root of your project (make sure the file is created where all your ``agentc`` commands will be running). These variables configure key settings, such as API keys, database connections, and other project-specific options, that are essential for running CLI commands and building agent workflows.

Make sure to review the required variables and populate them with appropriate values before starting your project.

.. code-block:: ini
       :caption: Add the following to your ``.env`` file, and replace the default values with your desired settings

       ------------------------------------------ REQUIRED -----------------------------------------
       # Couchbase-specific environment variables.
       CB_CONN_STRING=localhost
       CB_USERNAME=Administrator
       CB_PASSWORD=password

       # The OpenAI API key.
       OPENAI_API_KEY=...

       ------------------------------------------ OPTIONAL ------------------------------------------
       # These are from the starter agent as described in `travel-agent` example

       # Agent Catalog specific environment variables that identify where the catalog is stored.
       AGENT_CATALOG_CONN_STRING=couchbase://localhost
       AGENT_CATALOG_USERNAME=Administrator
       AGENT_CATALOG_PASSWORD=password
       AGENT_CATALOG_BUCKET=travel-sample

       # For example purposes, we want to see what our agent is doing (this is CF-specific).
       CONTROLFLOW_TOOLS_VERBOSE=true
       PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL=CRITICAL

       # ControlFlow specific environment variables (which are really just Prefect environment variables).
       PREFECT_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4200/api"

       # Default model used when encoding our tool / prompt descriptions.
       DEFAULT_SENTENCE_EMODEL=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2

       # To stop sentence_transformers from being fussy about multiple imports.
       TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false

The list above details the environment variables required to enable Agent Catalog functionalities.
Some variables are **mandatory** for using both the CLI commands and the SDK:

1. Couchbase specific environment variables

* ``CB_CONN_STRING``: Couchbase connection string, which can be set to localhost or obtained from Capella. For more info on connection strings, refer to the `official documentation <https://docs.couchbase.com/python-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html#connection-strings>`_.

* ``CB_USERNAME``: Username needed to sign in to your Couchbase cluster, either hosted locally (if ``CB_CONN_STRING`` = ``localhost``) or within your Capella organization. When using Capella, this is the username associated with the database access key required for the connection string set up.

* ``CB_PASSWORD``: Password needed to sign in to your Couchbase cluster, either hosted locally (if ``CB_CONN_STRING`` = ``localhost``) or within your Capella organization. When using Capella, this is the password associated with the database access key required for the connection string set up.

2. LLM Connection

* ``OPENAI_API_KEY``: To start using Agent Catalog functionalities, you require an OpenAI API key. Refer to the next section on :ref:`OpenAI API Key usage <How does Agent Catalog use my OpenAI API key?>` to know more about how we leverage OpenAI to enhance agent workflow development.

The rest of the variables are optional and contextual to the ``travel-agent`` example as explained in `this repository <https://github.com/couchbaselabs/agent-catalog-example>`_.


How does Agent Catalog use my OpenAI API key?
---------------------------------------------

Agent Catalog does not use your OpenAI API key directly. While developing agent workflows with your preferred frameworks, a large language model (LLM) is essential for tasks such as response generation and decision-making. Agent Catalog simplifies this process by maintaining a comprehensive catalog of tools and prompts that your agents may require. It generates and stores embeddings of tool and prompt descriptions, allowing for efficient semantic searches to retrieve relevant items.

Agent Catalog itself does not rely on an LLM, which means it does not utilize your API key. The LLM is solely needed by your agent development framework, such as ControlFlow, Langgraph, or similar, to perform tasks like generating responses and executing complex reasoning.

Can I use any LLM ?
-------------------

Absolutely! You are free to choose any LLM for your agent workflow development, as long as the framework you select supports it. This flexibility allows you to tailor your agentâ€™s capabilities to your specific needs and preferences.
